# Welcome!

Funkin' View (AKA FNF' in Peote-View) is a successor of [Friday Night Funkin' Zenith](https://github.com/SomeGuyWhoLovesCoding/Zenith-FNF-Public) and is the fastest running opengl fnf engine in haxe of now.

This is being optimized and organized as frequently as possible for a flexible codebase making it faster to finish. It aims to be the new standard of FNF modding.

This project was started a few months ago, so expect this repository to be very active!

# Setup

Instll these haxelibs:

Lime - ``haxelib install lime``

Peote-view - ``haxelib git peote-view https://github.com/maitag/peote-view.git``

HXCPP - ``haxelib install hxcpp``

Format - ``haxelib install format`` (This one is also used in peote-view for `TextureData.fromFormatPNG`)

Miniaudio - ``haxelib git miniaudio https://github.com/alchemy-haxe/genkit_miniaudio.git``

After that, make sure that you are on this screen:![img](repo_assets/image-1.png)

And press "y" to go to the download page for visual studio.

PRESS COMMUNITY!![img](repo_assets/image-2.png)

And it'll automatically download the setup executable for you.

Make sure that you're looking at this window:![img](repo_assets/image.png)

Then, you want to go to the Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19041) and MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (Latest). That's literally it.

(Oh yeah and it requires at least 6GB of free storage space on a drive to install btw)

And you're all set up! Just run `lime test cpp` and it works!
