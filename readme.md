# Welcome!

FNF' in Peote-View, otherwise known as "Funkin' View" is a successor of [Friday Night Funkin' Zenith](https://github.com/SomeGuyWhoLovesCoding/Zenith-FNF-Public) which offers ultra-performant gameplay and an incredibly flexible codebase, and is currently aiming to become the new standard of FNF modding.

This project just got started, so expect this repository to be very active!

# Setup

Instll these haxelibs:

``haxelib install lime``

``haxelib git peote-view https://github.com/maitag/peote-view.git``

``haxelib install hxcpp``:

``haxelib install format`` (This one is also used in peote-view for `TextureData.fromFormatPNG`)

``haxelib git genkit_miniaudio https://github.com/alchemy-haxe/genkit_miniaudio.gut``

After that, make sure that you are on this screen:![img](repo_assets/image-1.png)

And press "y" to go to the download page for visual studio.

PRESS COMMUNITY!![img](repo_assets/image-2.png)

And it'll automatically download the setup executable for you.

Make sure that you're looking at this window:![img](repo_assets/image.png)

Then, you want to go to the Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19041) and MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (Latest). That's literally it.

(Oh yeah and it requires at least 6GB of free storage space on a drive to install btw)

And you're all set up! Just run `lime test (your platform)` and it works!
